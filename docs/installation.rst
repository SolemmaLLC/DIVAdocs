Missing the DIVA toolbar or receiving an 'unknown command' error?
	If you do not see the DIVA toolbar docked at the top of the screen, you will need to browse to the C:\\\DIVA\\\ folder and open either the 32bitPluginFiles or the 64bitPluginFiles folder depending on the version of DIVA you have installer. Once in the appropriate 32/64-bit folder, drag the DIVA.rui and DIVA.rhp files into the Rhino viewport.

Having troubles installing DIVA-for-Grasshopper?
	If the DIVA and ArchSim components do not show up on the Grasshopper canvas, then the C:\\\DIVA\64bitPluginFiles\\\DIVA.Daylight.ghlink and C:\\\DIVA\\\64bitPluginFiles\\\ArchSim\\\ArchSim.ghlink files can be saved in the Grasshopper components folder, C:\\\Users\\\YourUserName\\\AppData\\\Roaming\\\Grasshopper\\\Libraries\\\.
	
Licensing
	By default, DIVA comes with a 30-day trial license that functions the same as the full version. Students are eligible to register for a free educational license. Professional users may purchase a perpetual license for individual computers. Large institutions and schools may contact us to discuss pricing for a floating site license.
